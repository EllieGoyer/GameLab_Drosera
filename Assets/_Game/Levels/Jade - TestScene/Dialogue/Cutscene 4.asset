    myText: As the humans of the crew prepare to depart on their next excavation,
      DD74 sits at the table fiddling with her model train and muttering in a frustrated
      tone.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d6e4337556b7504c9f9a0232eb5f0f7, type: 2}
    myText: There must be a solution to this... Is there not a reset button? No 'return
      to factory default settings' input?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 726917f8ca25588478e761320a8f64a0, type: 2}
    myText: Hm? Does what have a reset, Dee? Your model train engine? It's broken?
      I thought you only got it earlier this year?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d6e4337556b7504c9f9a0232eb5f0f7, type: 2}
    myText: It isn't broken, it's been hacked. At least, that's I believe happened...
      It still works. It still declares random historical train facts... but it does
      so far too frequently! And it's a bit... nihilistic.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c6ec762721d186a419cb1d3ca3df43a3, type: 2}
    myText: ...I'm sorry, what? It's spouting nihilist philosophy?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 14d00c576283fbc4ab2fd5e134447f5c, type: 2}
    myText: "Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment. Whereas putting
      coal or wood fuel into the engine\u2019s boiler is the first step on the road
      to traveling by train!"
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d6e4337556b7504c9f9a0232eb5f0f7, type: 2}
    myText: Not exactly nihilist philosophy... The train facts are just... quite
      bleak. Although it does occasionally quote Jean-Paul Sartre...

      Billie stares at the model train, bewildered.'

      Mira visibly tries not to laugh.'
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 14d00c576283fbc4ab2fd5e134447f5c, type: 2}
    myText: What can change the nature of a man? Nothing. What can change the nature
      of the train? The invention of the hydrogen fuel engine!
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 726917f8ca25588478e761320a8f64a0, type: 2}
    myText: Do you want me to help you fix it, Dee?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d6e4337556b7504c9f9a0232eb5f0f7, type: 2}
    myText: No, no, I am a fully capable, adult A.I. I can figure out how to reset
      a toy model train, thank-you very much!
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 726917f8ca25588478e761320a8f64a0, type: 2}
    myText: Are you sure?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c6ec762721d186a419cb1d3ca3df43a3, type: 2}
    myText: You sure you even want to? After all, all human activities are equivalent
      and are on principle doomed to failure.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d6e4337556b7504c9f9a0232eb5f0f7, type: 2}
    myText: You are not helping, Mira, dear.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c6ec762721d186a419cb1d3ca3df43a3, type: 2}
    myText: Hmm. Why'd you get a model train that spouts train facts anyways? Have
      you ever even seen a train?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d6e4337556b7504c9f9a0232eb5f0f7, type: 2}
    myText: No, I haven't. I simply find trains fascinating.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c6ec762721d186a419cb1d3ca3df43a3, type: 2}
    myText: Why though? Why trains?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d6e4337556b7504c9f9a0232eb5f0f7, type: 2}
    myText: I was born fascinated by trains... in a sense. When we A.I are 'born',
      we are given a randomized set of hobbies and interests from any point in human
      history. It just so happens that trains are one of mine.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c6ec762721d186a419cb1d3ca3df43a3, type: 2}
    myText: Huh. Okay. Makes sense, I guess.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 14d00c576283fbc4ab2fd5e134447f5c, type: 2}
    myText: 'I am lost, abandoned in the present. I try in vain to rejoin the past:
      I cannot escape. Press the button on the left side of my chassis for more historical
      train facts!'
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d6e4337556b7504c9f9a0232eb5f0f7, type: 2}
    myText: "Unfortunately, tinkering is not one of my interests. And it looks like
      everyone is ready to depart\u2026 I give up. Billie?"
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 726917f8ca25588478e761320a8f64a0, type: 2}
    myText: Of course, Dee! I'll get it fixed up real quick! Promise.
